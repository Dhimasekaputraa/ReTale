    <h2>About ReTale</h2>
    <p>
      ReTale is a secondhand book marketplace dedicated to giving preloved books a new home. 
      We believe that every book carries stories beyond its pages — from the words inside 
      to the journey it has taken with its previous owners. Our mission is to make reading 
      accessible, affordable, and sustainable for everyone.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 2025, ReTale started with a simple idea: to connect book lovers through 
      the power of sharing. What began as a small community of readers exchanging their 
      collections has grown into a trusted platform where thousands of books have found 
      their second owners. Today, ReTale continues to inspire a culture of reading while 
      supporting sustainability by reducing book waste.
